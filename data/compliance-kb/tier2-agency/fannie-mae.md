## DTI Limits

Fannie Mae's maximum allowable DTI ratio is 50% for loans submitted through Desktop Underwriter (DU) when the borrower receives an Approve/Eligible recommendation. For manually underwritten loans, the maximum DTI ratio is 36%, or up to 45% with compensating factors such as reserves, low LTV, or strong credit history.

The DTI ratio is calculated by dividing the borrower's total monthly obligations (including the proposed housing expense) by gross monthly income.

## Loan-to-Value Requirements

Maximum LTV ratios depend on the occupancy type, property type, and loan purpose. For a primary residence purchase with a one-unit property, the maximum LTV is 97% (with eligible mortgage insurance). For a two-unit primary residence purchase, the maximum LTV is 85%. For investment properties, the maximum LTV is 85% for a one-unit purchase and 75% for a two-to-four-unit purchase.

Refinance transactions generally have lower maximum LTV ratios than purchase transactions.

## Minimum Credit Score

Fannie Mae requires a minimum representative credit score of 620 for most loan products. For certain high-LTV loans (LTV > 95%), stricter credit score requirements may apply. The representative credit score is determined by selecting the middle (or lower of two) scores from each borrower and using the lowest representative score among all borrowers.

DU may approve loans with credit scores at or above the minimum through its comprehensive risk assessment, which considers multiple factors beyond the credit score alone.

## Documentation Requirements

Standard documentation requirements include: two years of federal tax returns (or one year for salaried employees with stable income), 30 days of pay stubs, two months of asset statements, and employment verification within 10 business days of the note date.

Self-employed borrowers must provide two years of federal tax returns including all schedules and a year-to-date profit and loss statement if more than three months have passed since the end of the most recent tax year.
