## Loan Estimate Timing

The creditor must deliver or place in the mail the Loan Estimate no later than the third business day after receiving the consumer's application. The consumer must receive the Loan Estimate no later than the seventh business day before consummation. If the Loan Estimate is mailed, the consumer is considered to have received it three business days after it is placed in the mail.

An application is defined as the submission of the following six pieces of information: the consumer's name, the consumer's income, the consumer's Social Security number, the property address, the estimated value of the property, and the mortgage loan amount sought.

## Closing Disclosure Timing

The creditor must ensure the consumer receives the Closing Disclosure no later than three business days before consummation of the transaction. If the Closing Disclosure is mailed or delivered electronically, the consumer is considered to have received it three business days after delivery.

If certain changes occur between the time the Closing Disclosure is provided and consummation, the creditor must provide a corrected Closing Disclosure and the consumer must receive it at least three business days before consummation.

## Changed Circumstances

Changed circumstances that permit revised disclosures include: an extraordinary event beyond the control of any interested party, information specific to the consumer or the transaction that the creditor relied upon when providing the original estimate that was inaccurate or changed after the disclosures were provided, or new information specific to the consumer or transaction that the creditor did not rely on when providing the original Loan Estimate.

If a changed circumstance results in increased charges, the creditor may provide revised disclosures to the consumer no later than three business days after receiving information sufficient to establish that such changed circumstance has occurred.

## Tolerance Thresholds

Zero tolerance: charges that cannot increase from the Loan Estimate include transfer taxes, fees paid to an unaffiliated third party if the consumer did not shop for the service and the creditor did not permit shopping, and fees paid to the creditor's affiliates.

10% cumulative tolerance: charges where the total increase cannot exceed 10% include recording fees, and fees for third-party services where the consumer was permitted to shop but chose a provider from the creditor's written list.

No tolerance limit: charges that can change without restriction include prepaid interest, property insurance premiums, and fees for third-party services where the consumer shopped and selected their own provider.
