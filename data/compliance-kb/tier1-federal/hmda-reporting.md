## Reporting Thresholds

A financial institution must report HMDA data if it meets the following criteria: it is a depository institution with assets above the reporting threshold (adjusted annually), originated at least 25 closed-end mortgage loans in each of the two preceding calendar years, or originated at least 200 open-end lines of credit in each of the two preceding calendar years.

The asset-size exemption threshold is adjusted annually by the CFPB. Institutions below the threshold are exempt from HMDA reporting requirements.

## Required Data Fields

The Loan/Application Register (LAR) requires reporting of data fields organized into the following categories: application information (loan type, loan purpose, preapproval), property information (property type, occupancy, census tract), applicant information (income, credit score model), loan information (loan amount, interest rate, loan term, loan-to-value ratio), and action taken (disposition and dates).

Additional fields include total loan costs, total points and fees, origination charges, discount points, lender credits, rate spread, HOEPA status, and manufactured home information where applicable.

## Reporting Deadlines

Financial institutions must submit their LAR data to the appropriate federal agency by March 1 following the calendar year for which the data are collected. For example, data collected during calendar year 2024 must be submitted by March 1, 2025.

Institutions must also make their modified LAR available to the public within three business days of a request.

## Data Integrity

Institutions must maintain procedures reasonably designed to produce accurate and complete HMDA data. The data must be reported using the formats and procedures specified by the CFPB. Institutions are subject to examination for HMDA compliance, and data quality issues may result in enforcement actions.
