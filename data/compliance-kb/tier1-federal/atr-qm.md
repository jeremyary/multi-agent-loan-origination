## Ability-to-Repay General Requirement

A creditor must make a reasonable, good faith determination that a consumer has a reasonable ability to repay a residential mortgage loan according to its terms. The creditor must consider at least eight underwriting factors: current or reasonably expected income or assets, current employment status, the monthly payment on the covered transaction, the monthly payment on any simultaneous loan, the monthly payment for mortgage-related obligations, current debt obligations (including alimony and child support), the monthly debt-to-income ratio or residual income, and credit history.

## Qualified Mortgage Safe Harbor

A qualified mortgage (QM) provides a safe harbor or rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ATR requirement. To qualify for QM status, the loan must meet specific criteria including that total points and fees do not exceed 3% of the total loan amount (for loans of $100,000 or more), the loan term does not exceed 30 years, and the loan does not contain negative amortization, interest-only payments, or balloon payments.

The DTI threshold for QM safe harbor status is 43%. A loan with a DTI ratio exceeding 43% does not qualify for the QM safe harbor under the general QM definition, though it may qualify under the GSE patch or other QM categories.

## Points and Fees Cap

For a loan to meet QM standards, total points and fees must not exceed: 3% of the total loan amount for loans of $100,000 or more; $3,000 for loans from $60,000 to $100,000; 5% for loans from $20,000 to $60,000; $1,000 for loans from $12,500 to $20,000; and 8% for loans less than $12,500.

Points and fees include origination charges, discount points exceeding bona fide discount thresholds, fees paid to affiliates, compensation paid to mortgage brokers, and real estate-related charges in certain circumstances.

## Seasoned QM

A loan that is not a QM at consummation may achieve QM status after a seasoning period of 36 months if: the loan has no more than two delinquencies of 30 or more days and no delinquencies of 60 or more days during the seasoning period, the consumer is not currently 30 or more days past due, the loan has not been subject to a workout or modification, and the loan satisfies the QM product feature and points-and-fees requirements.
