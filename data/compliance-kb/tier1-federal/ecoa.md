## Prohibited Bases

A creditor shall not discriminate against an applicant on a prohibited basis regarding any aspect of a credit transaction. Prohibited bases include: race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract), the fact that all or part of the applicant's income derives from a public assistance program, or the fact that the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.

## Adverse Action Requirements

When a creditor takes adverse action on an application, the creditor must provide the applicant with a notice of adverse action. The notice must include: a statement of the action taken, the name and address of the creditor, a statement of the provisions of ECOA prohibiting discrimination, the name and address of the appropriate federal agency, and either a statement of specific reasons for the adverse action or a disclosure of the applicant's right to request such reasons.

The creditor must provide the adverse action notice within 30 days after taking adverse action on a completed application, or 30 days after taking adverse action on an incomplete application (unless notice is otherwise not required).

## Appraisal Copy Requirement

For first-lien mortgage loans, a creditor must provide the applicant with a copy of all appraisals and other written valuations developed in connection with the application promptly upon completion, or three business days prior to consummation, whichever is earlier. The creditor must provide copies no later than at consummation.

The applicant may waive the timing requirement and receive copies at or before consummation, except where the waiver would violate other applicable laws.

## Data Collection

A creditor that receives an application for credit primarily for the purchase or refinancing of a dwelling occupied or to be occupied by the applicant as a principal residence must collect specific applicant characteristics for monitoring purposes. This data collection requirement is mandatory and separate from underwriting decisions.

The information collected must not be used in any credit decision. Creditors must maintain a firewall between demographic data collection and credit decision-making processes.
