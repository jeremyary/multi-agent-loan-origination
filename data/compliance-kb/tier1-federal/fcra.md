## Permissible Purpose

A consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report only for a permissible purpose. For mortgage lending, the primary permissible purpose is that the person requesting the report intends to use the information in connection with a credit transaction involving the consumer on whom the information is to be furnished.

The creditor must have a permissible purpose at the time the report is obtained. Obtaining a report without a permissible purpose violates the FCRA and may result in civil liability.

## Adverse Action Notices

If a creditor takes adverse action based in whole or in part on information contained in a consumer report, the creditor must provide the consumer with: notice of the adverse action, the name, address, and telephone number of the consumer reporting agency that furnished the report, a statement that the agency did not make the adverse decision and is unable to provide specific reasons, and notice of the consumer's right to obtain a free copy of the report and to dispute inaccurate information.

The notice must be provided within 30 days of taking adverse action.

## Consumer Dispute Rights

A consumer may dispute inaccurate information in their credit file by contacting the consumer reporting agency. The agency must conduct a reasonable investigation within 30 days (45 days if the consumer provides additional information during the investigation period). If the disputed information is found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable, the agency must promptly modify or delete it.

The furnisher of the disputed information must also investigate the dispute, review all relevant information, and report the results to the consumer reporting agency.

## Prescreening

A creditor may use prescreened lists of consumers who meet certain criteria for firm offers of credit. The creditor must make a firm offer of credit to each consumer on the list. The offer must include a clear disclosure that the consumer's credit report was used, that the consumer may opt out of future prescreened offers, and provide the method for opting out.
