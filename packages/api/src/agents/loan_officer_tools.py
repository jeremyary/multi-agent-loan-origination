# This project was developed with assistance from AI tools.
"""LangGraph tools for the loan officer assistant agent.

These wrap existing services so the LO agent can review applications,
inspect documents, flag documents for resubmission, check underwriting
readiness, and submit applications to underwriting.

Design note -- session-per-tool-call:
    Each tool opens its own ``SessionLocal()`` context rather than sharing
    a single session across the agent turn.  This is intentional: LangGraph
    tool nodes run as independent async tasks and may execute in any order,
    so sharing a session would risk interleaved flushes, stale reads, and
    MissingGreenlet errors.  The per-tool pattern keeps each DB interaction
    self-contained and avoids cross-tool state leakage.
