# This project was developed with assistance from AI tools.
"""LangGraph tools for underwriter condition lifecycle management.

Wraps condition service functions so the underwriter agent can issue,
review, clear, waive, return conditions, and view condition summaries.

Design note -- session-per-tool-call:
    Each tool opens its own ``SessionLocal()`` context rather than sharing
    a single session across the agent turn.  See underwriter_tools.py
    for rationale.
