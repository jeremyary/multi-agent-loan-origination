# This project was developed with assistance from AI tools.
"""LangGraph tools for underwriting decision management.

Wraps decision service functions so the underwriter agent can render
decisions, draft adverse action notices, and generate LE/CD documents.

Design note -- session-per-tool-call:
    Each tool opens its own ``SessionLocal()`` context rather than sharing
    a single session across the agent turn.  See underwriter_tools.py
    for rationale.

    This tool uses a two-phase flow to ensure human confirmation:

    Phase 1 (confirmed=false, the default): Returns a PROPOSAL showing
    what the decision would do (decision type, stage transition, AI
    agreement). The proposal is stored in agent state with a unique
    proposal_id. No database records are created. You MUST present
    this proposal to the underwriter and wait for their explicit
    confirmation.

    Phase 2 (confirmed=true): After the underwriter confirms, call
    again with confirmed=true and the proposal_id from Phase 1 to
    execute the decision. This validates the proposal_id, creates
    the decision record, transitions the application stage, and
    writes audit events.

    IMPORTANT: Never set confirmed=true without first showing the
    proposal to the underwriter and receiving their explicit approval.
    The proposal_id parameter is required when confirmed=true.

    Args:
        application_id: The loan application ID.
        decision: One of "approve", "deny", or "suspend".
        rationale: Explanation for the decision.
        confirmed: Set to true only after the underwriter confirms the proposal.
        proposal_id: Required when confirmed=true. The ID from Phase 1 proposal.
        denial_reasons: Required for denials. List of specific reasons.
        credit_score_used: Credit score at time of decision (for denials).
